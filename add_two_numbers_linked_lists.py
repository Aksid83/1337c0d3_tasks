"""
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. 
The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. 
Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example:
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

"""
Just like how you would sum two numbers on a piece of paper, we begin by summing the least-significant digits, 
which is the head of l1 and l2. Since each digit is in the range of 0â€¦9, summing two digits may "overflow". 
For example 5+7=12. In this case, we set the current digit to 2 and bring over the carry=1 to the next iteration. 
Carry must be either 0 or 1 because the largest possible sum of two digits (including the carry) is 9+9+1=19.
